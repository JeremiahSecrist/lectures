# Self Directed Learning With Docker

###### By Jeremiah Secrist

## Issue
I want to teach you all about docker 
but don't have enough time

## Why
Docker is complex

## Issue
Many moveing parts
Proficcency takes time

Research is a powerful tool, it enables us to see if others have paved a road for our own understanding. We all build upon shoulders of giants. 

This stage of learning is focused around the following:

 - finding Learning the full list of requirments to learn the desired skill
 - Identify main resources
 - Evaluate resources for credibility
 - To narrow the scope
 - Setup a working structure to practice the skills you expect to learn

Personal deadlines are important in aiding in ones own learning abilities. If you have forever to learn something it will be accomplished never. Time frames let our minds evaluate the following:

 - Actionable goals
    overview goals while providing a direction, do not provide any one specific action to do.
    As such, it is advised to break these goals down into somthing clear, conscise and obtainable within a resonable period.

- Acountability
    Without accountability one is not able to improve themselves. 
    Make sure to find some way to make the project matter outside simply just learning it. Try making your personal goals known by friends and family. As such they may ask you about your progress or deadlines you've set. most importantly write them down in a place where you will see them frequently. 

 - Routines
    These enable you to consistnetly perform a tasks where other situation may force you to fight against the grain to study. one idea could be to intergrate reading with another existing habit. say when you go to the coffee shop you bring you book and leave the phone at home. 
    As you build the routines take time to evaluate if they are working for you or not.

After proper preperation has been made for your own learning experience it is key to actually start doing it. Go into this knowning the plan will never be perfect and no itenerary will be 100% completely for a project. Simply getting started is the most powerful thing you can do. 

---

As hinted at in prior sections be direct in your approach. This being to clearly know what you want to get out of a particular learning experience. This enables you to better critique your own learning experience in the future. Be explicit in your actions vs implicit.

---

To give a better example of this here are two scenarios.

## Implicit
> I want to be a better reader. 
While this is a wonderful aspiration it is implicit in many fashions. What is a good reader? What is a better reader? How are you going to do this? There are many questions asked to fully understand this simple statment.

## Explicit 
> I want to improve my reading skills by reading at least 1hr a day. My goal is to create a better edjucation habbit for myself that will aid in learning in other areas. I plan to take note of how many pages I read and critique how well I comprehendded to the topic. My first book I read will by Ultralearning by Scott H. Young. I wish to read this book as it also pairs well with my other education goals. I will start reading tomorrow when I go to the coffee shop.

This contains a lot more information as to contrast the first one. 
We can measure the following:
 - Why: To improve ones educational experience
 - Where: At the coffee shop 
 - When: Tomorrow
 - What: Ultralearning by Scott H. Young
 - How:  By reading for at least 1hr a day
 - Metrics: Pages read, comprehension

This also ties into your everyday life and isn't arbitrary in nature.

Life is full of constant distractions provided in many ways. Cellphones, friends, the internet, noisy envorments. They manifest in may ways and hinder our ability to learn effectivly within our given time frames. In some situations you may be able to remove the distractions enirely, for example setting your phone at home entirely. While in other situations you might not be able to remove the distractions you can learn to recognise when the interfere with your work. Either after you enter or leave your study session take note of what took your off your goal. Over time you will get better at negating these distractions from disturbing your flow of productivity.

We are all experts in isolation, further inspection from outside sources we can quickly learn out own flaws in a given topic. Take writing or public speaking as examples. In order to increase our caoabilities it is crucial to request feedback those who have more expertise. It is also important to know how to filter out noise or bad feedback from others.

 - is the feedback vague? 
 - am I able to apply the feedback to my next project?
 - does it conflict with pre-existing knowledge?
 - does this focus on what I wish to improve?
 - is it consistently mentioned by others?

many other questions like this aid us in taking action on our own draw backs

But most importatntly don't let feedback discourage you from your goals! They are meant to guide you, not hinder you. 

---

It is important to know that reading and following guides and tutorials will only get you so far on any given topic. The art of pushing beyond what is avaible that we truely grow. Try new ways of doing things and write down the results. Take note of how well they did or did not work. In what ways within the future could these be applied? Why did this new tecnique fail? Take time to dedicate venturing down the untrodden paths that you see. 

Take any and all failures as a chance to reflect and grow as a person.

Congratulations, you have learned a new skill! Now what? Having a skill does not mean it will stay with you forever. You must either decide if you are ok with having to relearn the skill, or if you will maintin the skill activly. My personal favorite is mastery, to go above and beyond on this skill.

## Maintain
If you decide to maintine the new skill keep a regular interval of practice and self evaluation is key. Setup a weekly challange to test you are still razer sharp in the topic at hand. Be sure to find a way if possible to work it naturally into your daily routine. 

## Relearn
Somtimes our plate is already full of things to maintine, in these situations it ok to relearn something later when you need it. But make sure you are ok with the costs of relearning a topic down the road when the time arrises. This is where evaluation of value over knowledge is key. Knowing you can apply it daily often results in one maintining the knowledge by default. 

## Mastery
Studies have shown that mastery of a skill keeps more of the baseline reguarding knowledge and problem solving. Take the saying "it's like riding a bike". This refers to the idea that making things second nature persist in a way that simply being skilled is not mastery. Mastery is the idea that knowledge is intune with you on an inimate level.

If the intensity of this learning suggested is not for you is not appealing. Small habits can have a large impacts on your life. Take brushing your teeth for instance, it's 1 minute of your day every day for the rest of your life. But that small daily routine results in your teeth lasting long into your old age. Look for these small changes you can commit to that large ooutcomes down the roa

# Docker Time
Now that we have covered the topics and ways to improve our own learning expereince. Lets apply this to learning docker!
