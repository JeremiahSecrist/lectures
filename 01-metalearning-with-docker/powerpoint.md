# <!--fit--> Self Directed Learning

By Jeremiah Secrist

---

# <!--fit--> I am not here to teach you docker

---

# Rather to give you the tools to educate yourself
<!-- Discuss how at the end there are some excersizes to aid in exploring docker -->
--- 

# Why am I here?
 1. Express the importance of self directed learning
 2. Give you tools and stratagies to aid you in solving your own learning experience problems
 3. Give you a taste of what indepenent study is like, and how to optimise it.

# What is self directed learning?
- Simply to put education back into your hands
---

# What does education start with?
 - Goals
 - Destinations
 - Research
 - Projects
 - Metrics
 - Understanding yourself!

---
# Research is a powerful tool!
 <!-- it enables us to see if others have paved a road for our own understanding. We all build upon shoulders of giants.  -->

This stage of learning is focused around the following:

 - Finding a full list of requirments to learn the desired skill
  - Break it down
 - Identify main resources
 - Evaluate resources for credibility
 - To narrow the scope
 - Setup a working structure to practice the skills you expect to learn

## Personal Deadlines 
An important point in aiding ones own learning abilities.
Forever is never, as such it is important to frame our goals with the following:

 - Actionable goals
    <!-- overview goals while providing a direction, do not provide any one specific action to do.
    As such, it is advised to break these goals down into somthing clear, conscise and obtainable within a resonable period.
    -->
- Acountability
    <!--
    Without accountability one is not able to improve themselves. 
    Make sure to find some way to make the project matter outside simply just learning it. Try making your personal goals known by friends and family. As such they may ask you about your progress or deadlines you've set. most importantly write them down in a place where you will see them frequently. 
    -->
 - Routines
    <!--
    These enable you to consistnetly perform a tasks where other situation may force you to fight against the grain to study. one idea could be to intergrate reading with another existing habit. say when you go to the coffee shop you bring you book and leave the phone at home. 
    As you build the routines take time to evaluate if they are working for you or not. 
    -->

# Just get started
 - preparation is never perfect, so don't stress!
<!-- After proper preperation has been made for your own learning experience it is key to actually start doing it. Go into this knowning the plan will never be perfect and no itenerary will be 100% completely for a project. Simply getting started is the most powerful thing you can do.  -->

---

# Be Direct and Explicit

 - Clearly define your learning goals
 - Critique your learning experience for future improvement
 - Be explicit in your actions, not implicit
<!-- As hinted at in prior sections be direct in your approach. This being to clearly know what you want to get out of a particular learning experience. This enables you to better critique your own learning experience in the future. Be explicit in your actions vs implicit. -->
---

# Lets evaluate the following two scenarios
One is implicit the other is explicit.

---

## Implicit
> I want to be a better reader. 
<!-- While this is a wonderful aspiration it is implicit in many fashions. What is a good reader? What is a better reader? How are you going to do this? There are many questions asked to fully understand this simple statment. -->

---

## Explicit 
> I want to improve my reading skills by reading at least 1hr a day. My goal is to create a better edjucation habbit for myself that will aid in learning in other areas. I plan to take note of how many pages I read and critique how well I comprehendded to the topic. My first book I read will by Ultralearning by Scott H. Young. I wish to read this book as it also pairs well with my other education goals. I will start reading tomorrow when I go to the coffee shop.

---

## What can we glean from this?
### Reduced ambiguity!

We can measure the following:
 - Why: To improve ones educational experience
 - Where: At the coffee shop 
 - When: Tomorrow
 - What: Ultralearning by Scott H. Young
 - How:  By reading for at least 1hr a day
 - Metrics: Pages read, comprehension

# Distractions abound!

- Life is full of distractions that hinder our learning effectiveness.
- Some distractions can be removed entirely, while others cannot. It is up to us to evaluate them.
- Recognize when distractions interfere with work and take note of them.
- Over time, become better at negating distractions.

<!-- Life is full of constant distractions provided in many ways. Cellphones, friends, the internet, noisy envorments. They manifest in may ways and hinder our ability to learn effectivly within our given time frames. In some situations you may be able to remove the distractions enirely, for example setting your phone at home entirely. While in other situations you might not be able to remove the distractions you can learn to recognise when the interfere with your work. Either after you enter or leave your study session take note of what took your off your goal. Over time you will get better at negating these distractions from disturbing your flow of productivity. -->

# Feedback is king!
### But not all feedback
 - Is the feedback vague? 
 - Am I able to apply the feedback to my next project?
 - Does it conflict with pre-existing knowledge?
 - Is this focusing on what I wish to improve?
 - Was consistently mentioned by others?

<!-- We are all experts in isolation, further inspection from outside sources we can quickly learn out own flaws in a given topic. Take writing or public speaking as examples. In order to increase our caoabilities it is crucial to request feedback those who have more expertise. It is also important to know how to filter out noise or bad feedback from others. -->

# <!-- fit--> Don't let feedback discourage you! 
They are meant to guide you, not hinder you. 

---
# Studying has limits:
### Apply them!
 - Reading guides and tutorials can only take you so far on a given topic.
 - Pushing beyond what is available is how true growth occurs.
 - Experiment with new ways of doing things and write down the results.
 - Take note of how well they worked or didn't work.
 - Consider future applications of new techniques and analyze why they failed.
 - Dedicate time to exploring unexplored paths.
 - Take any and all failures as a chance to reflect and grow as a person. 

<!-- It is important to know that reading and following guides and tutorials will only get you so far on any given topic. The art of pushing beyond what is avaible that we truely grow. Try new ways of doing things and write down the results. Take note of how well they did or did not work. In what ways within the future could these be applied? Why did this new tecnique fail? Take time to dedicate venturing down the untrodden paths that you see.  -->

# Success!
What is next?
<!-- Congratulations, you have learned a new skill! Now what? Having a skill does not mean it will stay with you forever. You must either decide if you are ok with having to relearn the skill, or if you will maintin the skill activly. My personal favorite is mastery, to go above and beyond on this skill. -->

---

## <!-- fit --> Maintain you knowledge
<!-- If you decide to maintine the new skill keep a regular interval of practice and self evaluation is key. Setup a weekly challange to test you are still razer sharp in the topic at hand. Be sure to find a way if possible to work it naturally into your daily routine.  -->

---

## <!-- fit --> Relearn it later
<!-- Somtimes our plate is already full of things to maintine, in these situations it ok to relearn something later when you need it. But make sure you are ok with the costs of relearning a topic down the road when the time arrises. This is where evaluation of value over knowledge is key. Knowing you can apply it daily often results in one maintining the knowledge by default.  -->

---

## <!-- fit --> Mastery to go above and beyond
<!-- Studies have shown that mastery of a skill keeps more of the baseline reguarding knowledge and problem solving. Take the saying "it's like riding a bike". This refers to the idea that making things second nature persist in a way that simply being skilled is not mastery. Mastery is the idea that knowledge is intune with you on an inimate level. -->
