Personal deadlines are important in aiding in ones own learning abilities. If you have forever to learn something it will be accomplished never. Time frames let our minds evaluate the following:

 - Actionable goals
    overview goals while providing a direction, do not provide any one specific action to do.
    As such, it is advised to break these goals down into somthing clear, conscise and obtainable within a resonable period.

- Acountability
    Without accountability one is not able to improve themselves. 
    Make sure to find some way to make the project matter outside simply just learning it. Try making your personal goals known by friends and family. As such they may ask you about your progress or deadlines you've set. most importantly write them down in a place where you will see them frequently. 

 - Routines
    These enable you to consistnetly perform a tasks where other situation may force you to fight against the grain to study. one idea could be to intergrate reading with another existing habit. say when you go to the coffee shop you bring you book and leave the phone at home. 
    As you build the routines take time to evaluate if they are working for you or not.
