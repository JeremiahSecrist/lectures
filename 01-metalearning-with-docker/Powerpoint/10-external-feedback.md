We are all experts in isolation, further inspection from outside sources we can quickly learn out own flaws in a given topic. Take writing or public speaking as examples. In order to increase our caoabilities it is crucial to request feedback those who have more expertise. It is also important to know how to filter out noise or bad feedback from others.

 - is the feedback vague? 
 - am I able to apply the feedback to my next project?
 - does it conflict with pre-existing knowledge?
 - does this focus on what I wish to improve?
 - is it consistently mentioned by others?

many other questions like this aid us in taking action on our own draw backs

But most importatntly don't let feedback discourage you from your goals! They are meant to guide you, not hinder you.
