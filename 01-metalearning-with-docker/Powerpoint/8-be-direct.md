As hinted at in prior sections be direct in your approach. This being to clearly know what you want to get out of a particular learning experience. This enables you to better critique your own learning experience in the future. Be explicit in your actions vs implicit.

To give a better example of this here are two scenarios.

## Implicit
> I want to be a better reader. 
While this is a wonderful aspiration it is implicit in many fashions. What is a good reader? What is a better reader? How are you going to do this? There are many questions asked to fully understand this simple statment.

## Explicit 
> I want to improve my reading skills by reading at least 1hr a day. My goal is to create a better edjucation habbit for myself that will aid in learning in other areas. I plan to take note of how many pages I read and critique how well I comprehendded to the topic. My first book I read will by Ultralearning by Scott H. Young. I wish to read this book as it also pairs well with my other education goals. I will start reading tomorrow when I go to the coffee shop.

This contains a lot more information as to contrast the first one. 
We can measure the following:
 - Why: To improve ones educational experience
 - Where: At the coffee shop 
 - When: Tomorrow
 - What: Ultralearning by Scott H. Young
 - How:  By reading for at least 1hr a day
 - Metrics: Pages read, comprehension

This also ties into your everyday life and isn't arbitrary in nature.
