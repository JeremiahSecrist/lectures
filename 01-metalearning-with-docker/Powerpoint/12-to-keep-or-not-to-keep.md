Congratulations, you have learned a new skill! Now what? Having a skill does not mean it will stay with you forever. You must either decide if you are ok with having to relearn the skill, or if you will maintin the skill activly. My personal favorite is mastery, to go above and beyond on this skill.

## Maintain
If you decide to maintine the new skill keep a regular interval of practice and self evaluation is key. Setup a weekly challange to test you are still razer sharp in the topic at hand. Be sure to find a way if possible to work it naturally into your daily routine. 

## Relearn
Somtimes our plate is already full of things to maintine, in these situations it ok to relearn something later when you need it. But make sure you are ok with the costs of relearning a topic down the road when the time arrises. This is where evaluation of value over knowledge is key. Knowing you can apply it daily often results in one maintining the knowledge by default. 

## Mastery
Studies have shown that mastery of a skill keeps more of the baseline reguarding knowledge and problem solving. Take the saying "it's like riding a bike". This refers to the idea that making things second nature persist in a way that simply being skilled is not mastery. Mastery is the idea that knowledge is intune with you on an inimate level.
